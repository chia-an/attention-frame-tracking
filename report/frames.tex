\section{FRAMES dataset}

FRAMES dataset is created specifically for the frame tracking task. Its dialogues are longer and more complicated comparing to the ones in other datasets, and there are special labels for frame tracking. The dialogues were collected in a wizard-of-oz fashion: two people playing the role of user and system, with the user having a goal hidden from the system, and with the system having a database unknown to the user \cite{kelley1984iterative, rieser2005corpus, wen2016network}. The users' tasks are designed so that users have to go back-and-forth between options to achieve their goal and thus creates complicated dialogue structures.
% what is action, slot, value?
For each utterance, there are annotations of NLU labels, i.e. action, slot, and value, and an optional frame reference label if this action-slot-value tuple is related to a previous frame. The frame is then represented as a list of slot-value pairs.

% user turn only? A: mention in experiment
The frame references appearing in FRAMES can be categorized into three types: explicit, anaphora, and implicit. Explicit reference is when the NLU label appears in the referred frame, i.e. the user mentions a slot value explicitly. Reference using anaphora is similar except that the user uses anaphora instead of a slot value. The problem of resolving this kind of reference is closely related to the coreference resolution in dialogues. Implicit reference happens when the utterance itself contains no clue and the reference depends heavily on the context of the dialogue. In such cases, the referred frame is usually the one mentioned in the previous turn.

Here are some examples of each type of frame reference. The slot values having a reference are in bold.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Explicit: a detailed example is in Table \ref{tab:ex-explicit}.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item How many days would I be in \textbf{Kobe}? %(dial id = 1, turn id = 12)
        \item Ok, I would like to purchase the trip with the \textbf{4 star} hotel. %(dial id = 4, turn id = 6)
    \end{itemize}

    \item Anaphora: a detailed example in Table \ref{tab:ex-anaphora}.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item No, \textbf{that}'s too far for me. I need a flight that leaves from Birmingham. %(dial id = 1, turn id = 10)
        \item Ok, then I would like to purchase \textbf{this package}. What activities are included in this package? %(dial id = 1, turn id = 16)
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item Implicit: without context, these might look the same as explicit references. The difference is that the slots and values here do not appear in any existing frames thus can not be explicit references. A detailed example is in Table \ref{tab:ex-implicit}.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item{
            %SYSTEM: Yes, I do. I have one for 8445.37 USD. Would you like to book this package? The guest rating is 7.15 / 10 and ... at 1:00 a.m.
            Is \textbf{breakfast} included? %(dial id = 3, turn id = 8)
        }
        \item{
            %SYSTEM: Ok. I can upgrade your flights to business class for a total of 2715.60 USD. Would you like that?
            Yes perfect. How is the \textbf{hotel}? %(dial id = 33, turn id = 6)
        }
        \item{
            %SYSTEM: Okay, our best deal in Santos is a 7 day trip at a 3.5 star hotel near a museum and a palace.
            Reasonable. Any free \textbf{wifi} for the kids? %(dial id = 1191, turn id = 4)
        }
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
