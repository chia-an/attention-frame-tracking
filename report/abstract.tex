Frame tracking is a way to embed memory into a dialogue system. Inspired by how human resolves frame references, we propose a new model with an attention mechanism. We also devise a new method to generate synthetic frame tracking data. Empirical analyses show that our method improves accuracy by 6.7 percentage points and shortens training time.
