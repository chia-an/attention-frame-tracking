In this paper, we study how to model memory in a dialogue system using frame tracking. We propose a new model using attention mechanisms to mimic the way humans approach this problem. We evaluate several types of attention mechanisms using the FRAMES dataset. The results give strong evidence of the efficacy of attention, and also show that query-key and scaled query-key are the best mechanisms among the ones we have tried. In addition to the new model, we propose a method to generate synthetic frame tracking data from ordinary dialogues. Experimens show that the training converges faster with model pre-trained on synthetic datasets. As a final touch, we propose a framework for improving a frame tracking model after its deployment.
